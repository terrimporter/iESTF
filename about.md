</p><br>
Dr. Mehrdad Hajibabaei’s research focuses on the application of genomics information to biodiversity analysis, ranging from the elucidation of deep branches of the tree of life to the development and application of DNA-based tools for species identification (e.g., DNA barcoding, DNA metabarcoding). Mehrdad is one of the pioneers using high-throughput genomics technologies such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the assessment of biodiversity in samples. These samples vary from bulk environmental water, soil, and sediments. He has played a leadership role in establishing and managing large-scale research projects and collaborative networks such as the Canadian Barcode of Life Network and the International Barcode of Life (iBOL).
